Open3DS
=======

Open3DS is a simple library for parsing and displaying 3DS models.
It is written in C++ using OpenGL and SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

The code is probably quite buggy. It's more for learning purposes than anything
else.


Example
-------

The example was written using CodeBlocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/) IDE.
Open3DS implements hierarchy in 3DS files and it can be tested in the example.

Controls:

* Left mouse button - select/move object
* R, T - select between rotation and translation
* X, Y, Z - select the axis of movement
* Right/middle mouse button - move camera
* Scroll wheel - zoom
* A - show/hide axes
